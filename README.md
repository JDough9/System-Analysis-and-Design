# System-Analysis-and-Design'
-Justin Dougherty
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass. They wanted a system where the students could take drivers test online and schedule their driving lessons. In hopes to help students pass more drivers tests. 
What did you do particularly well?
I prioritized the use/case to encorporate all of the possible needs the customer would have in this project. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
In the second project. I failed to adequadely describe the diagrams to the designers. In the future I would work to articulate the diagrams more. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think the UML diagrams are a great technique. It is pivotal to incorparate the users needs in every facet. Starting with basic needs and tying them all together is a necessary strategy for creating diagrams. In turn it all translates into designing the system.
